        Hi, I'm Jeffrey. 
    </h2>
    <p class="aboutDesc">
        When I went into college, I never thought that I'd enjoy studying CS.  <br>
    
    
        Since then, a lot has changed. I love the subject, and I can't imagine myself studying anything else. <br>
        At the same time, I can see that my education falls short in some areas.<br>
        One of those areas would be in real world application of the concepts I learn. <br>
        I have been learning some of that on my own, mainly through web development. <br>
        But I'm open to exploring any other avenues. I'm confident I'll pick them up quickly.<br>
        I hope to gain more experience in application with an internship.<br>
        Feel free to reach out to me!
